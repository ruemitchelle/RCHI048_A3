I changed the design of the inital design proposed based on the feedback received. Initally I didnt have a task list but I added it to the focus page.

I began creating the task list on the home page and realised it was better to add the date and complete here as well for the benefit of the user.

After further evaluation I realised I was still missing a few other components of the design. So I had to redesign the layout of the website. I firstly started by changing the index page which is the dashboard, here I added the task list to have all the features it needed, it also made more sense for the user to enter the home page and be able to add the things they need to do before they start using the apps on the website. 


The focus page has a pomodoro timer on it and a music player. The pomodor timer has the options of focus, a five minute break and a 30 minute break. These are to help the user focus on their study but give them appropriate breaks during their study.

I changed the kanban board on the final page, this page was initially a calendar but after looking at it in relation to the other features on the website, the kanban board and the calendar where to similar to the task list on the dashboard page as it featured the ability to complete/incomplete tasks. The purpose of these two pages became to similar, to fix this I changed the final page into a flashcard page. Here the user is able to create their acronyms and the meanings. The user can use this page to memorise words/phrases they need for upcoming exams and such. 

I also decided to use the local storage to keep the words the user inputs for the flashcards, this way the user doesnt need to constantly add new ones when they enter the page.

The blue background made the pages feel too empty so I finished the website by adding background images to all the pages, each image is to suit the idea behind the page.
